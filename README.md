# OOP_UI
The following is a build of the OOP module assignment

# Concept
When given the assignment brief which explained to a student to create a Sci-Fi UI. I briefly pondered through various different ideas. One that stood out was to recreate the Pit Boy from the game series Fallout. However, I became aware that many other students were attempting to recreate the Pit Boy as well. I then came to the conclusion where if I was to be unqiue, I would have to create my own UI. 

The UI is based upon the idea of the Cold War eventually escalating to full out war. In the 1960’s when America received word of Russia’s nuclear capabilities and their intentions with said capabilities, US President John F. Kennedy developed a secret program within NASA, regarded as DAWN. The DAWN program was the development of long range rockets that could be powered with powerful nuclear reactors. The reasoning for this was so that if a nuclear war were to begin, a group of humans could be placed into a rocket and fly space while carrying out research on various nearby planets and repopulate or to wait and return to Earth once it was habitable. In this universe, the war does indeed begin and the DAWN program, whilst still in development, is launched whilst America’s enemies begin war. 

The UI created is an engineer UI. This provides an engineer on board statistical information of the ship and its state while also tracking the BPM of said engineer. Humans in space was a new reality in this era so the tracking of one’s health at this time was conceived to be imperative.
