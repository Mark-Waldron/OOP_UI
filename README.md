# OOP_UI
The following is a build of the OOP module assignment

# Concept
When given the assignment brief which explained to a student to create a Sci-Fi UI. I briefly pondered through various different ideas. One that stood out was to recreate the Pit Boy from the game series Fallout. However, I became aware that many other students were attempting to recreate the Pit Boy as well. I then came to the conclusion where if I was to be unqiue, I would have to create my own UI. 

The UI is based upon the idea of the Cold War eventually escalating to full out war. In the 1960’s when America received word of Russia’s nuclear capabilities and their intentions with said capabilities, US President John F. Kennedy developed a secret program within NASA, regarded as DAWN. The DAWN program was the development of long range rockets that could be powered with powerful nuclear reactors. The reasoning for this was so that if a nuclear war were to begin, a group of humans could be placed into a rocket and fly space while carrying out research on various nearby planets and repopulate or to wait and return to Earth once it was habitable. In this universe, the war does indeed begin and the DAWN program, whilst still in development, is launched whilst America’s enemies begin war. 

The UI created is an engineer UI. This provides an engineer on board statistical information of the ship and its state while also tracking the BPM of said engineer. Humans in space was a new reality in this era so the tracking of one’s health at this time was conceived to be imperative.  

#Features
The UI has five features.

* Home Page
  * Contains information on ship status and a radar scope
* Health Page
  * Shows users current BPM
* Radio
  * A radio with a host of 4 songs
* Ship
  * A page that displays the live data of the ship. 
* Data
  * Displays the data of the ship in a line graph form

#Controls

* LEFT and RIGHT keys to navigate
* UP and DOWN to change keys songs and graph
* Z to exit
* ENTER to change page
* S to play song
* P to stop song

#Functionality

The sketch uses a switch based menu to to go between different menu options. The keyPressed function checks all user input and perfoms appropriate actions depending what page the user is on. If required, some pages classes share a super class that draw hosts the dimenions of the UI's screen.

* Home
  * The home page uses pushMatrix and popMatrix to draw the radar scope. To display the statistical data, a method calls upon string format library methods to display percentage values to the user. The radio icon is a PShape drawn which is only shown when a song is playing. This is achieved through boolean flag checks.
  
* Health
  * The Health page uses trigometric functions to create a unique heart rate animation on each iteration. The average BPM is calculated throughout the running of the prgram.

* Radio
  * The radio contains a sub menu of which consists of 4 songs. The UP and DOWN keys allow a user to navigate through each song. Once a user hits P whilst hovering over a song, the keyPressed method will utilising the SoundFile class and play the song file via the Song Class. Whilist a song is playing, a Sin Wave is generated to give an effect using trigometric algorithms.

* Ship Status
  * Data of the ship represented in bar charts and bubble graphs. All text is scaled appropriately using mapping functions.

* Data Display
  * Displays data by taking all data loaded from file and displays it via a line graph
  
#Key Concepts
The program contains Inheritance for many classes are an extention of the Dimension class. This was to reduce the amount of code in the project.
